                <p>Poetry is so important because it helps us understand and appreciate the world around us. Poetry’s strength lies in its ability to shed a “sideways” light on the world, so the truth sneaks up on you. No question about it. Poetry teaches us how to live. Poetry is like the Windex on a grubby car window—it bares open the vulnerabilities of human beings so we can all relate to each other a little better. You know how I’m a flag-waving advocate of poetry and I’m so thrilled to feature fellow poet Lidy Wilks on my blog today. Lidy’s new book, Can You Catch My Flow? is now available and she stopped by to share why poetry is important to her and to give away her books (more details at the end of this post).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Poetry, if we let it and embrace it, can offer us a way to empathize with one another. In its immediacy, poetry is a counselor helping us to understand one another. Leading us away from hate to love, from violence to mercy and pity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I’ve said it once before that poetry is a bridge. An immediate path to becoming better people and being the change in the world. Creating a world less about tearing each other down and apart, and more about coming together. Helping us to realize that we’re not as different as we think. And despite our differences, we are not alone in our grief, pain, joy or happiness.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Reading and writing poetry is the greater good. Whose benefits are the rebuilding and forging a more connected and caring world.</p>
